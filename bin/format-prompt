# PROMPTING
#        When  executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt PS1 when it is ready to read a command, and the
#        secondary prompt PS2 when it needs more input to complete a command.  Bash displays PS0 after it reads  a  com-
#        mand  but  before  executing  it.  Bash displays PS4 as described above before tracing each command when the -x
#        option is enabled.  Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized  by  inserting  a  number  of  backslash-
#        escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:
#               \a     an ASCII bell character (07)
#               \d     the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
#               \D{format}
#                      the  format  is passed to strftime(3) and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty
#                      format results in a locale-specific time representation.  The braces are required
#               \e     an ASCII escape character (033)
#               \h     the hostname up to the first `.'
#               \H     the hostname
#               \j     the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
#               \l     the basename of the shell's terminal device name
#               \n     newline
#               \r     carriage return
#               \s     the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion following the final slash)
#               \t     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
#               \T     the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
#               \@     the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
#               \A     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
#               \u     the username of the current user
#               \v     the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)
#               \V     the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
#               \w     the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated  with  a  tilde  (uses  the  value  of  the
#                      PROMPT_DIRTRIM variable)
#               \W     the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
#               \!     the history number of this command
#               \#     the command number of this command
#               \$     if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $
#               \nnn   the character corresponding to the octal number nnn
#               \\     a backslash
#               \[     begin  a  sequence  of  non-printing  characters, which could be used to embed a terminal control
#                      sequence into the prompt
#               \]     end a sequence of non-printing characters
#
#        The command number and the history number are usually different: the history number of a command is  its  posi-
#        tion  in the history list, which may include commands restored from the history file (see HISTORY below), while
#        the command number is the position in the sequence of commands  executed  during  the  current  shell  session.
#        After  the  string  is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expan-
#        sion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the promptvars shell option (see the description of the  shopt
#        command under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
#        PROMPT_COMMAND
#               If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.
#        PROMPT_DIRTRIM
#               If  set  to a number greater than zero, the value is used as the number of trailing directory components
#               to retain when expanding the \w and \W prompt string escapes (see PROMPTING below).  Characters  removed
#               are replaced with an ellipsis.
#        PS0    The  value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and displayed by interactive shells after
#               reading a command and before the command is executed.
#        PS1    The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and used as  the  primary  prompt  string.
#               The default value is ``\s-\v\$ ''.
#        PS2    The  value  of  this  parameter  is  expanded  as with PS1 and used as the secondary prompt string.  The
#               default is ``> ''.
#        PS3    The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the select command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above).
#        PS4    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and the value is printed before  each  command  bash
#               displays during an execution trace.  The first character of the expanded value of PS4 is replicated mul-
#               tiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection.  The default is ``+ ''.
